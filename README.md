# Xiaomi-M365-Pro-Luggage-Rack

A 3D printable luggage rack design for the Xiaomi M365 Pro electric scooter that does not prevent the folding down of the handlebars for carrying.

# Overview

The design includes a 3 part rack (left stay, right stay and rack surface) that mounts in place of the existing side covers of the M365 pro scooter.  The rack is designed to fit around the existing hardware (such as the disc brake calliper) without the need to alter any parts.  Since the rack blocks access to the original folding hook (mounted on the rear mudguard) the design includes a new hook design which is higher and placed further back to compensate for the angle of the original hook's mount.

The design requires a strong flexible plastic and is therefore suitable for filaments such as PETG and ABS.  The design requires a printer with a 20x25cm print surface.

# Printing instructions

## Overview

The model has been printed and tested on the Prusa MK3S/MMU2S printer using PETG filament. All parts fit on a 20x25 printing bed.

The OpenSCAD source files provide a parameter interface that allows you to render either the whole model or the individual parts (placed flat on the axis ready for STL (or other 3D format) export).  This requires OpenSCAD 2019.05 or later.

The github repository for the model can be found at https://github.com/simoninns/Xiaomi-M365-Pro-Luggage-Rack
